## What I learned

- To implement an optimal layout for mobile devices, I tried to use @media rule in CSS.

- Moreover, entrance animation for toast message is also added.
```css
.appear_animation{
    animation-name: appear;
    animation-duration: 1s;
}
@keyframes appear{
    from {
        top: -30px;
    }
}
```

- Besides, this is my first time to code in JavaScript. Various methods are used in this project, such as modifying the HTML content using .innerHTML, 
```js
document.getElementById("firstnameerror").innerHTML = error_required;
```

adding or removing element's class using .classList, 
```js
document.getElementById("firstname").classList.add("error_border");
```

and setting styles of an element using .style.
```js
toast.style.visibility = 'visible';
```
